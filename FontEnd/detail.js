While the summer is, undoubtedly, a lovely time to visit, savvy travellers will find the Lakes and their towns and villages are an equally beautiful destination in the autumn. The scenery is ablaze with colour, the summer crowds have thinned out and thereâ€™s plenty to see and do during, no matter the weather.'
